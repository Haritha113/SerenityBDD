Without @Managed: WebDriver is still managed by Serenity, and it works
based on the configurations in your properties file.
You just won't have the ability to directly control theWebDriver instance
via the @Managed annotation (for example, you can't specify a particular driver for a field).

With @Managed: You explicitly control WebDriver initialization for specific page objects
or steps and specify the driver in the annotation, giving you more fine-grained control.

In short,
you donâ€™t necessarily need @Managed for Serenity to initialize the driver,
as it handles driver creation internally.
However, @Managed gives you the ability to fine-tune driver management within specific contexts.
